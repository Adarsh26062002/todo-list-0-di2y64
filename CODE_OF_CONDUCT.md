# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community and project

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Spam or promotional content unrelated to the Todo List project

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently
any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including project
repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, and any public or private
communication specifically referencing the Todo List project. The Code of
Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project
in public spaces, such as using official project email addresses or social media
accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at
project-maintainers@example.com or by creating a private issue with the
"maintainer" tag on GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The
project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident.

Project maintainers will follow these steps in response to reported violations:

1. Review the reported violation and gather necessary information
2. Communicate privately with the involved parties
3. Issue a public or private warning if appropriate
4. Implement temporary or permanent bans for repeated or severe violations

Anyone subject to enforcement actions may appeal the decision by contacting
the project maintainers at project-maintainers@example.com with a detailed
explanation of why they believe the enforcement action should be reconsidered.
