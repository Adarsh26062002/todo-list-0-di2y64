| React | 18.x | UI framework | Component-based library for building interactive user interfaces with efficient rendering through the Virtual DOM |
| Redux | 4.x | State management | Predictable state container providing a centralized store for application state with unidirectional data flow |
| Redux Toolkit | 1.9.x | Redux enhancement | Official toolset for efficient Redux development that simplifies common tasks and reduces boilerplate code |
| CSS3 | - | Styling | Modern styling capabilities with responsive design features and cross-browser compatibility |

### Supporting Libraries and Utilities

| Library | Version | Purpose | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| react-redux | 8.x | Redux integration | Official React bindings for Redux, providing optimized component connections to the Redux store |
| nanoid | 4.0.0 | ID generation | Lightweight utility for generating unique identifiers for todo items |
| immer | (included in Redux Toolkit) | Immutable state | Allows writing simpler immutable update logic by working with "draft" states |
| classnames | (used internally) | CSS class management | Utility for conditionally joining CSS class names, simplifying dynamic styling |

## State Management Architecture

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern with Redux at its core:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Interface] -->|User Interaction| B[Action Dispatch]
    B -->|Action Object| C[Redux Middleware]
    C -->|Processed Action| D[Reducers]
    D -->|New State| E[Redux Store]
    E -->|State Changes| A
    E -.->|State| F[localStorage]
    F -.->|Hydrated State| E
```

### Redux Implementation

The Redux store is structured with two primary slices:

1. **Todos Slice** - Manages the collection of todo items with the following actions:
   - `addTodo`: Creates a new todo with unique ID and initial incomplete status
   - `toggleTodo`: Switches a todo's completion status
   - `editTodo`: Updates the text content of an existing todo
   - `deleteTodo`: Removes a todo from the collection

2. **Filters Slice** - Manages the active filter selection:
   - `setFilter`: Updates the current filter (All, Active, Completed)

Each slice utilizes Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` API to define reducers and automatically generate action creators and action types.

## Client-Side Storage

The application uses the browser's localStorage API for client-side persistence:

| Storage Key | Content | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `todoApp.todos` | Serialized todo items | Persists the collection of tasks between sessions |
| `todoApp.filter` | Current filter setting | Remembers the user's last applied filter |

The storage implementation includes:
- **Throttling** to prevent excessive writes during rapid state changes
- **Error handling** for quotas, parsing failures, and unavailable storage
- **Serialization/deserialization** of state with JSON

## Type System

TypeScript provides comprehensive type safety throughout the application:

```typescript
// Core data types
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

enum FilterStatus {
  All = 'all',
  Active = 'active',
  Completed = 'completed'
}

// State structure types
interface TodosState {
  entities: Todo[];
}

interface FiltersState {
  status: FilterStatus;
}

// Combined Root State
interface RootState {
  todos: TodosState;
  filters: FiltersState;
}
```

## Form Validation

The application implements client-side validation for todo entries with the following rules:

| Validation Rule | Constraint | Error Message |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Non-empty | Text must not be empty | "Todo text cannot be empty" |
| Maximum Length | Text cannot exceed 200 characters | "Todo text cannot exceed 200 characters" |
| Content Quality | Text cannot be only whitespace | "Todo text cannot be only whitespace" |

Validation is consistently applied throughout the application in both creation and editing operations.

## UI Component Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App] --> B[TodoForm]
    A --> C[TodoList]
    A --> D[Footer]
    C --> E[TodoItem]
    D --> F[FilterButtons]
    
    subgraph "Redux Store Connection"
      B -.->|Dispatch addTodo| G[Redux Store]
      E -.->|Dispatch toggleTodo/editTodo/deleteTodo| G
      F -.->|Dispatch setFilter| G
      G -.->|State Updates| C
      G -.->|State Updates| D
    end
```

Each component is implemented as a functional component with React hooks for state management and Redux integration.

## Core Architectural Components

### State Management

The application uses Redux with Redux Toolkit for state management, featuring:

1. **Store Configuration** (`src/app/store.ts`):
   - Central Redux store with todos and filters reducers
   - localStorage persistence middleware
   - Redux DevTools integration for debugging
   - Typed state and dispatch for TypeScript safety

2. **Todo Slice** (`src/features/todos/todosSlice.ts`):
   - Manages todo items with actions for CRUD operations
   - Includes memoized selectors for filtering and counting
   - Validation integrated in action creators

3. **Filters Slice** (`src/features/filters/filtersSlice.ts`):
   - Manages filter state (All, Active, Completed)
   - Provides selectors for current filter

4. **Custom Hooks** (`src/app/hooks.ts`):
   - Type-safe hooks for accessing Redux state and dispatch
   - Simplifies component integration with Redux

### Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Root Components**:
   - `App.tsx` - Entry point that sets up Redux Provider and layout
   - `MainLayout.tsx` - Main application layout structure

2. **Feature Components**:
   - `TodoForm` - Input form for creating new todos
   - `TodoList` - Container for rendering filtered todos
   - `TodoItem` - Individual todo with editing/completion functionality
   - `Footer` - Filter controls and status information

3. **Cross-Cutting Components**:
   - `ErrorBoundary` - Catches and handles runtime errors

### Data Persistence

The application utilizes localStorage for client-side persistence:

1. **LocalStorage Service** (`src/utils/localStorage.ts`):
   - Functions for saving/loading state to/from localStorage
   - Error handling for storage unavailability
   - Fallbacks for data corruption

2. **Persistence Middleware** (`src/middleware/localStorage.ts`):
   - Automatically persists state changes to localStorage
   - Implements throttling to prevent excessive writes
   - Handles storage errors gracefully

### Validation

Input validation is implemented throughout the application:

1. **Validation Utilities** (`src/utils/validation.ts`):
   - Reusable validation functions for todo text
   - Error message generation
   - Integrated with form components and Redux actions

2. **Validation Hook** (`src/hooks/useValidation.ts`):
   - Custom hook for form validation
   - Manages validation state and error messages

## Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **User Interaction** → User interacts with a component (e.g., adds a todo)
2. **Action Dispatch** → Component dispatches an action (e.g., `addTodo`)
3. **Reducer Processing** → Todo reducer processes the action and updates state
4. **State Update** → Redux store updates with new state
5. **Component Re-rendering** → Connected components re-render with new data
6. **Persistence** → localStorage middleware persists the updated state

This pattern ensures predictable state management and makes the application easier to debug and maintain.

## Key Folders and Files Explained

### src/web/types

This folder contains TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application:

- **index.ts**: Defines interfaces and types for the entire application, including:
  - `Todo`: Represents a single todo item with id, text, and completed status
  - `TodosState`: Represents the todos slice in the Redux store
  - `FilterStatus`: Enum for the possible filter states (All, Active, Completed)
  - `FiltersState`: Represents the filters slice in the Redux store
  - `RootState`: The root state structure of the Redux store
  - `ValidationResult`: For form validation results
  - `LocalStorageState`: Structure for data saved in localStorage

These types ensure type safety across the application and help with code completion in your IDE.

### src/web/configs

Contains configuration files and constants:

- **constants.ts**: Defines application constants like:
  - Storage keys for localStorage
  - CSS class names
  - Test IDs for component testing
  - UI text constants

  - Filter options
  - Keyboard key constants

- **validation.config.ts**: Contains validation rules and configuration for form inputs, including:
  - Maximum and minimum length for todo text
  - Error messages for validation failures
  - Validation patterns

Using centralized constants makes it easier to maintain the application and avoid magic strings throughout the codebase.

### src/web/app

Core Redux setup and application-wide hooks:

- **store.ts**: Configures the Redux store using Redux Toolkit:
  - Combines reducers for todos and filters

  - Configures Redux DevTools
  - Exports TypeScript types for the store

- **hooks.ts**: Provides typed hooks for accessing the Redux store:
  - `useAppDispatch`: For dispatching actions with correct typing
  - `useAppSelector`: For selecting state from the store with correct typing

These hooks ensure type safety when interacting with Redux throughout the application.

### src/web/features

Contains feature modules organized by domain. Each feature has its own Redux slice:

#### features/todos

Manages todo items:

- **todosSlice.ts**: Redux Toolkit slice for todo items:
  - Actions: `addTodo`, `toggleTodo`, `editTodo`, `deleteTodo`
  - Selectors: `selectAllTodos`, `selectFilteredTodos`, `selectActiveTodoCount`, `selectCompletedTodoCount`
  - Reducers for handling each action
  - Initial state loading from localStorage

## Core Application Flow

1. **Application Initialization**:
   - Application starts in `index.tsx`
   - Redux store is initialized in `store.ts`
   - Initial state is loaded from localStorage
   - React components render based on the initial state

2. **Adding a Todo**:
   - User enters text in `TodoForm`
   - Form validates input using `useValidation` hook
   - On submit, `addTodo` action is dispatched
   - `todosSlice` reducer adds the new todo to state
   - `localStorage` middleware persists the updated state
   - React re-renders the `TodoList` with the new item

3. **Toggling a Todo**:
   - User clicks checkbox in `TodoItem`
   - `toggleTodo` action is dispatched with todo ID
   - Reducer updates the completed status in state
   - State change triggers re-render with updated styling
   - Footer item count updates automatically

4. **Editing a Todo**:
   - User double-clicks todo text to enter edit mode
   - Input field shows current text and focuses
   - User edits text and presses Enter
   - Input is validated
   - If valid, `editTodo` action is dispatched
   - Reducer updates the todo text in state
   - Component returns to view mode with updated text

5. **Deleting a Todo**:
   - User clicks delete button on a todo item
   - `deleteTodo` action is dispatched with todo ID
   - Reducer removes the todo from state
   - List updates to remove the deleted item

6. **Filtering Todos**:
   - User clicks a filter button in Footer
   - `setFilter` action is dispatched with filter value
   - Filter state is updated in Redux
   - `selectFilteredTodos` selector filters todos based on current filter
   - TodoList re-renders with filtered items
   - Active filter button is highlighted

7. **Data Persistence**:
   - Redux middleware listens for state changes
   - When state changes, relevant portions are serialized
   - Serialized state is stored in localStorage
   - On application restart, state is loaded from localStorage

## Core Redux Flow

1. **Action Creation**:
   - Actions are defined in feature slices (todosSlice.ts, filtersSlice.ts)
   - Each action has a type and payload
   - Actions are dispatched from components using `useAppDispatch`

2. **Action Processing**:
   - Reducers in feature slices handle actions
   - Reducers update state immutably using Immer (via Redux Toolkit)
   - State is changed based on action payload

3. **State Selection**:
   - Components access state using selectors
   - Selectors are memoized using `createSelector` for performance
   - Components re-render only when relevant state changes
   - `useAppSelector` provides type-safe access to state

4. **Middleware Processing**:
   - Actions flow through middleware before reaching reducers
   - localStorage middleware persists state changes
   - Other middleware could handle side effects or logging

## Error Handling

1. **Form Validation**:
   - Input validation occurs in real-time or on submission
   - Validation errors are displayed inline
   - Prevents invalid data from reaching the Redux store

2. **localStorage Errors**:
   - Storage operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks
   - Falls back to in-memory operation if localStorage fails
   - Provides meaningful error messages in the console

3. **Component Errors**:
   - ErrorBoundary component catches rendering errors
   - Prevents entire application from crashing
   - Shows fallback UI when errors occur

## Testing Strategy

The codebase is designed for testability:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Tests for Redux reducers and selectors
   - Tests for utility functions like validation and localStorage

2. **Component Tests**:
   - Tests for individual React components
   - Mock Redux store for testing component behavior
   - Test different component states and user interactions

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Tests for component integration with Redux
   - Tests for complete user flows

4. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Tests entire application in a browser environment
   - Verifies that all features work together correctly

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Redux Selectors**:
   - Memoized selectors with `createSelector` prevent unnecessary calculations
   - Only re-renders components when relevant state changes

2. **React Optimizations**:
   - Functional components with hooks for better performance
   - Component memoization where appropriate
   - Key props for efficient list rendering

3. **localStorage Optimization**:
   - Throttled writes to prevent excessive storage operations
   - Selective persistence of only changed state portions

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Form submission with Enter key
   - Escape to cancel editing or clear form
   - Focus management for edit mode

2. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Semantic HTML elements with appropriate roles
   - ARIA attributes for interactive elements
   - Error messages linked to corresponding inputs

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Sufficient color contrast for text
   - Visual indicators for focus states
   - Clear error messaging
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Conclusion

This Todo List application demonstrates a well-structured React/Redux application with TypeScript. It follows modern best practices for organizing code, managing state, handling user input, and ensuring data persistence.

The feature-based architecture makes it easy to understand how different parts of the application work together, while the use of TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the codebase.

This application provides a solid foundation that could be extended with additional features like user authentication, backend integration, or more advanced todo management capabilities.
